Client:
William Rodriguez	Buyer	2 people, country (best timing & non-renovated) & city house (fast & central location), wants two houses



Houses located closer to the city center have higher price per sqft than houses on the countryside.
is proven right. 
 
The longer the time is in which a house has not been renovated the lower the condition of the house is.

Houses with a waterfront have tinier basements compared to houses without a waterfront.
Is proven wrong.

What do we want to know about the data first? 

RQ1 price of houses near center --> what houses are closer, what are their prices

RQ2: Renovation time and condition in a scatterplot or a histogram

RQ3: Barplot with x axis waterfront and no waterfront, y axis with size per sqft of basement


Questions open: 

Renovation = 0 and condition relation to reno=1(renovated) 


substrate the number of basements(sqft) of seattle from the dataset - check how many miles include seattle

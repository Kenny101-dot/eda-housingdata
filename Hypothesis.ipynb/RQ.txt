Client:
William Rodriguez	Buyer	2 people, country (best timing & non-renovated) & city house (fast & central location), wants two houses



Houses located closer to the city center have higher price per sqft than houses on the countryside.
   
The longer the time is in which a house has not been renovated the lower the condition of the house is.

Houses with a waterfront have tinier basements compared to houses without a waterfront.


What do we want to know about the data first? 

RQ1 price of houses near center --> what houses are closer, what are their prices

RQ2: Renovation time and condition in a scatterplot or a histogram

RQ3: Barplot with x axis waterfront and no waterfront, y axis with size per sqft of basement



What are the most important columns? 

Waterfront
Price
sqft basement
close to center
renovation
